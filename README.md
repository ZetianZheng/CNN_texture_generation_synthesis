# How to run the code

To run the code, execute following commands:

```shell
$cd src
$python cnn_executable.py  
Optimizing..
run [50]:
Style Loss : 188.507202 Content Loss: 0.000000
...

```

Then new pictures will automatically be generated and saved in '../results/image_name_file'

In the image_name_file, the picture with postfix: time is the graph about running time and iteration times. The picture image_name_0 is the original picture, and the rest pictures are generated by the model.

The evaluation scores will be saved in the file: 'scores'. It will automatically clean up while each time re-run the program.

If you want to do evaluation between images from other model, please save the result in a file with specific form: the original image with image_name_0,and rest image are image_name_x, x start from 1. and import it in the data file

then change the code in eva_excutable.py:

```python

g='../data/image_name_file' // image files
```

Then run the code with following command:

```shell
$cd src$
$python eva_excutable.py$
pleated_0101
data written
pleated_0102
data written
pleated_0154
data written
```

The result score will be saved in file: '../results/npscores'
